# byn >>=

byn is an interpreter written specially for learning, playing

and testing binary and hexadecimals too (soon enough).

I found rather anoying the convertion to integer java would do

when you were dealling with binary literals and trying to

understand what would happen if you ~0b00011001 .

So here it is, byn.

Coming soon
